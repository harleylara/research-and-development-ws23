# Influence in Performance of Feature Descriptor and Matching in Visual Keypoint-based Tracking for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)


- Use multiple datasets for assessment 
    - "We furthermore encourage authors to evaluate their algorithms based on multiple datasets and not just using a single in order to illustrate the generality of the method and not being optimized for a single dataset." [On measuring the accuracy of SLAM algorithms]
- Measuring relative error is better then global error 
    - "This overcomes serious shortcomings of approaches using a global reference frame to compute the error." [On measuring the accuracy of SLAM algorithms]
