## SLAM Challenges

before 2006:
- from "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM): Part II"
    - nonlinearity
    - data association
    - landmark characterization

## WP 1 - Identify Relevant Metrics for SLAM

Metrics:
- frame rate (slambench)
- energy consumption (slambench)
- absolute trajectory error (ATE) (slambench, are-we-there-yet)
- relative pose error (RPE) (slambench2, are-we-there-yet)
- reconstruction error (slambench2)
- reconstruction completeness (slambench2)
- absolute relative difference (slambench3)
- accurate depth percentage (slambench3)
- memory usage (slambench2)
- For semantic SLAM:
    - segmentation accuracy (slambench3)

Full collection of benchmarks are in my Zotero folder:
- [Introducing SLAMBench, a performance and accuracy benchmarking methodology for SLAM](./slambench.md)
- [SLAMBench2: Multi-Objective Head-to-Head Benchmarking for Visual SLAM](./slambench2.md)

Robustness against:
- Illumination changes (check sectio 2 in Robust SLAM Systems)
    - active exposure control
    - binary local descriptors for brightness normalization such as Census transform
    - illumination-invariant metrics to register images
- Dynamic objects
- Blured frames (due to fast camera movement for example)
    - frame deblurring
    - low quality but high frequency depth estimation

## WP 2 - Survey Datasets 

currently are in the [datasets.yml](./datasets.yml) file and in the zoreto folder.

TODO:
- [ ] add datasets scale.

## WP 3 - Extract Visual Keypoint-based based SLAMs

- Define selection criteria for SLAM implementation selection
- Identify SLAM implementations that meet the selection criteria

Filter for selection:
- Visual Keypoint-based
- Still public in the internet by the author(s)

List of SLAM libraries:
- [CAS Robot Navigation Toolbox](https://openslam-org.github.io/cas-rnt.html)
    - [source code](https://github.com/OpenSLAM-org/openslam_cas-rnt/tree/master)
